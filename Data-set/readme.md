### Datasets for "STELAR: A statistically consistent coalescent-based species trees estimation method by maximizing triplet consistency".
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
### Note:
-  (astral, stelar, mpest, superTriplests species trees are represented with `.astral.5.6.1` , `.stelar`, `.mpest` and `.SuperTriplets` extensions respectively)`
- All the dataset analyzed here, have already being created in other studies as well. We have just `rooted, trimmed` the dataset for the purpouse of our study Source of the original 
dataset is [here](https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/datasets/home?authuser=0).

**11-taxon datasets**: 10 replicates	 (four model conditions: 100gene-100bp, 100gene-1000bp, 1000gene-100bp, 1000gene-1000bp)

File contents:
  1. True species tree: 11-taxa/true-species-tree.strip
  2. estimated genes strongILS: 11-taxa/estimated_genes_strongILS/<X>/Rep<Y>_XgenesLS - where Y is the replicate number (1...10), and Y is the number of genes.
  3. simulated genes strongILS: 11-taxa/simulated_genes_strongILS/<X>/Rep<Y>_XgenesLS - where Y is the replicate number (1...10), and Y is the number of genes.
